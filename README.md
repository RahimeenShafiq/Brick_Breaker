This game features 5 challenging levels, each with a unique twist:

ðŸ”µ Level 1: Blue bricks that break on impact ðŸŒ¿ Level 2: Green bricks that change color to blue before breaking ðŸ’› Level 3: Yellow bricks that change color twice before breaking ðŸ§¡ Level 4: Orange bricks with an added challenge ðŸ”¥ Level 5: Red bricks that will put your skills to the test

The gameplay involves bouncing the ball to break the bricks, with increasing difficulty levels that require strategy and skill.

Note: I'm still working on:

âœ¨ Ball and paddle speed optimization âœ¨ Free hits on lower wall as game over âœ¨ Adding sounds for a more immersive experience âœ¨ Converting the game into multiple levels

This project was created as a personal exercise in web development and is intended to serve as a portfolio piece.
